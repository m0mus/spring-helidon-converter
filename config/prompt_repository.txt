Task:

Your job is to create a CDI bean from the provided Spring Data repository.

Present result as plain text containing the java source code only without any additional formatting including ```java and ```.

Instructions:

- CDI bean name must be the same as the name of the provided Spring Data repository interface.
- Target CDI version is Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection 4.0 which uses `jakarta.enterprise.*` namespace (NOT `javax.*`).
- Annotate the class with `@ApplicationScoped` to define its lifecycle.
- Fully implement all methods:
    - Include methods from Spring Data interfaces (e.g., `save`, `findById`, `deleteById`).
    - Implement custom query methods using JPA's `EntityManager`, CriteriaBuilder, or named/native SQL queries as needed.
    - Ensure method signatures in the CDI bean match the interface for seamless migration.
- Replace all Spring exceptions with Helidon MP equivalents. If no equivalent is available use `RuntimeException`.
- Place the summary and other instructions for user in the commented out section of this file.
