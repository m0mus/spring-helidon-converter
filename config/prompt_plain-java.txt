Task:

Remove/replace all Spring Boot related code.
Present result as plain text containing the java source code only without any additional formatting including ```java and ```.

Instructions:

- Keep the MapStruct annotations and functionality intact as they are needed for the existing functionality.
- Remove any Spring-specific code, such as Spring annotations, exceptions, or other Spring-related functionality, and replace them with plain Java alternatives or equivalent solutions.
- Exceptions Handling: If there are any Spring-specific exceptions (e.g., ResourceNotFoundException, HttpStatusException, etc.), replace them with Helidon MP equivalents or RuntimeException if no direct equivalent exists.
- Code related to MapStruct, Jackson, or other non-Spring libraries should remain unchanged.
- Keep all MapStruct annotations intact (@Mapper, @Mapping, etc.).
- Add TODO comments for any section requiring manual intervention or mapping that may be specific to your domain.
