Task:

Remove/replace all Spring Boot related code from the provided JPA entity.
Present result as plain text containing the java source code only without any additional formatting including ```java and ```.

Instructions:

- Replace Spring-specific annotations with standard JPA equivalents, ensuring compatibility with Helidon:
    - Examples: Replace `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` with compatible JPA annotations if required.
- Retain existing class structure and relationships (e.g., `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`) as-is unless modification is required for compatibility.
- Keep existing package name and class name.
